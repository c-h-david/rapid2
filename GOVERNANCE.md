# RAPID2 Project Governance

This governance model aims to create an open source community that encourages
transparency, contributions, and collaboration, but maintains sound technical
and quality standards. Our goal is to build a community comprised of members
across the RAPID2 model and beyond, including from private organizations,
universities, government organizations, and international organizations.

The project follows a contribution model where people and/or organizations who
do the most work have the most influence on project direction. Roles determine
decision making influence, and governance is set up to ensure that the
project's direction is in-line with requirements / goals while supporting
flexibility for future growth and membership. Technical decision making will
primarily be made through a "[consensus-seeking][URL_CONSEN]" approach within
the respective governing members.

### User

Users include anyone using the software for any purpose and is open to all.

### Contributor

Contributors include anyone that provides input to the project. This involves
code, issues, documentation, graphics, designs, or anything else that tangibly
improves the project. We encourage you to start contributing right away by
joining our [Discussions][URL_DISCUS] or submitting an [Issue][URL_ISSUES].
Suggesting a [Pull Request][URL_PULLRE] is also possible, following our
[Contributing Guidelines][URL_CONTRI].

### Committer

Subset of contributors who have been given write access to one or more project
repositories. Both contributors and committers can propose changes to the
project via pull requests, but only committers can formally review and approve
(merge) these requests. Any contributor who has made a non-trivial contribution
can be considered to be onboarded as a committer.

If you are planning on making a substantial contribution to the project or feel
that you qualify for being given write access to the repository, please make a
request to [Cedric H. David](https://github.com/c-h-david).

### Advisor

The advisor role is by invitation only and targets community leaders whose
activities have or could enhance the project or its community.

### Manager

Overall manager of the project with final authority over all key decisions when
consensus cannot be reached among deciding members. The product manager is
often chosen at the onset of project initiation and may be reassigned with
approval from all deciding members.

## Acknowledgments

Much of this governance model was adapted from other notable open source
projects including [node.js][URL_NODEJS], [OpenSSL][URL_OPENSS],
[PostgresQL][URL_POSTGR], and [OpenMCT][URL_OPENMC]. We would like to thank
those projects for setting the foundation upon which this model was built.
