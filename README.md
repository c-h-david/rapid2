The Routing Application for Programmed Integration of Discharge (RAPID) is a
river network routing model. Given external inflow to rivers, this model can
compute the flow of water everywhere in river networks made out of many
thousands of reaches.

### Setup Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/c-h-david/rapid2
cd rapid2
pip3 install .
```

### Run Instructions

```bash
rapid2 -nl namelist.yml
```

OR

```bash
rapid2 --namelist namelist.yml
```

### Usage Examples

Below is an example of what `namelist.yml` should include:

```yaml
---
Qex_ncf: './input/Test/Qext_Test_20000101_20000102.nc4'
Q00_ncf: './input/Test/Qinit_Test_20000101_20000102.nc4'

con_csv: './input/Test/rapid_connect_Test.csv'
kpr_csv: './input/Test/k_Test.csv'
xpr_csv: './input/Test/x_Test.csv'

IS_dtR: 900

Qou_ncf: './output/Test/Qout_Test_20000101_20000102_tst.nc4'
Qfi_ncf: './output/Test/Qfinal_Test_20000101_20000102_tst.nc4'
```

### Build Instructions

If you would like to build an Operating System to run RAPID2 from scratch,
we recommend Debian-based distributions and software packages for the
Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) are summarized in
[`requirements.apt`][URL_REQAPT]
to be installed with `apt-get`. All packages can be installed at once
using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
     $(grep -v -E '(^#|^$)' requirements.apt)
```

> Alternatively, one may install the APT packages listed in
> [`requirements.apt`][URL_REQAPT]
> one by one, for example:
>
> ```bash
> sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends python3.11
> ```

Also make sure that `python3` points to `python3.11`:

```bash
sudo rm -f /usr/bin/python3
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3.11 /usr/bin/python3
```
