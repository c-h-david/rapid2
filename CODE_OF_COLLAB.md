# Code of Conduct for Scientific Collaboration

> DRAFT. Work in progress: consider contributing to its associated GitHub
> issues at [NASA AMMOS][URL_AMMOS].

## Overview

This document outlines the expectations for collaboration, contribution, and
interaction with this project. It is designed to balance the needs of the
open-source community with the realities of scientific research, including
publishing, funding, and achieving scientific impact.

## Our Metrics of Success

As a project developed by scientific researchers, our primary metrics of
success are:

1. **Achieving scientific and societal impact**.
2. **Publishing articles in peer-reviewed journals**.
3. **Gathering funding to support ongoing research and development**.

We strive to balance the demands of open-source development with these goals,
and sustainable collaboration is key.

## Open Science Commitment

This project is committed to open science, transparency, and community-driven
development, in alignment with initiatives like
[NASA Open Science][URL_NASAO].
However, open-source development requires significant time and effort, and we
want to ensure all collaborators understand the expectations involved.

### What We Offer

1. **Access to cutting-edge research and software** for community use.
2. **Openness in sharing methods and ideas** while still competing in
   scientific research.
3. **Opportunities for collaboration** that align with our metrics of success.

### What We Expect from You

1. **Respect for Our Time and Resources**.
   Open-source software does not mean free support. We ask that you respect the
   fact that developing and maintaining software, alongside research, is a
   time-intensive process. Please make your queries clear and concise to help
   us assist you efficiently.

2. **Collaborate, Don't Compete**.
   Open science thrives on collaboration. We encourage you to collaborate with
   us, rather than compete against us, when using our software. If our tools
   are useful for your research, consider working with us directly to co-author
   papers, write joint proposals, contribute to further development, and/or
   share code and data.

3. **Contribute to Mutual Success**.
   Our open-source work is designed to benefit the scientific community at
   large, including you. If you find our software valuable:
   - **Cite our work** when using it.
   - **Engage us in conversations** about related publications, proposals, or
     presentations.
   - **Support our efforts** by contributing to our success metrics through
     co-authorship, joint funding proposals, sharing updates, or other forms of
     collaboration.

## Research Integrity and Collaborative Working

We adhere to the highest standards of research integrity, including those
outlined in the
[European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity][URL_Allea],
and expect the same from all collaborators.

### Key Principles

1. **Reliability**.
   Ensure the quality of research in design, methodology, analysis, and use of
   resources.

2. **Honesty**.
   Conduct, report, and communicate research transparently and without bias.

3. **Respect**.
   Show respect for all contributors, participants, ecosystems, and the broader
   community.

4. **Accountability**.
   Take responsibility for all aspects of the research process, from idea
   generation to publication.

### Collaborative Expectations

Successful collaboration requires transparency, communication, and mutual
respect. To ensure smooth and productive collaborations, we expect the
following:

1. **Mutual Goals and Standards**.
   All collaborators must agree from the outset on:
   - Research goals and expectations.
   - Standards for research integrity.
   - Intellectual property rights.
   - Procedures for handling conflicts or cases of misconduct.

2. **Clear Communication**.
   When working together, clear and transparent communication is essential.
   Please inform us of any plans to use or build upon our software,
   particularly if it involves publishing or applying for research funding.

3. **Support for Open Science**.
   We encourage you to align with our open science principles by:
   - Sharing your work openly.
   - Citing our contributions appropriately.
   - Acknowledging our work when applicable.

## Collaborative Roles

We consider everyone using this project to be collaborators ‚Äì members of our
community. We aim for all collaborators to benefit from the software and thrive
while doing so. The following table outlines different collaborative roles and
associated expectations for various types of collaborations.

### Collaborative Roles Matrix

| Collaborators | Cite | Tell Us | Joint Pubs | Joint Proposals | Maintenance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Independent User | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Supported User   | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Champion         | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | üí¨ | üí¨ | ‚ùå |
| Core Team        | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

**Symbol explanation:**

- ‚úÖ Expected as part of this role
- ‚ùå Not typically expected at this level
- üí¨ Let's discuss

### Independent User

Independent Users prefer to work with our project on their own, using it as an
off-the-shelf tool. This category suits those comfortable relying on existing
documentation without direct support. Please enjoy our software! Just be sure
to cite it in any publications (papers, talks, software, etc.) using the
information in
[`CITATION.cff`][URL_CITAT],
and share highlights like presentations, publications, or media coverage with
us. You're not expected to involve us in your proposals or publications.
Code maintenance is not expected for this role.
This group aligns with the **User** role in our
[`GOVERNANCE.md`][URL_GOVER].

### Supported User

Supported Users choose our project for their specific application and may
require our help with design, execution, analysis, or troubleshooting. In these
cases, we appreciate the opportunity to contribute to publications resulting
from this collaboration. We'll ensure our software is used and cited
appropriately, and our awareness of your work will naturally follow from our
involvement. You've likely secured your own funding or received a letter of
support from us; formal collaboration on proposals isn't expected at this
stage.
Code maintenance is not expected for this role.
This group aligns with the **User** role in our
[`GOVERNANCE.md`][URL_GOVER].

### Champion

Champions are individuals or team leads who have integrated our project into
their regular workflows. You likely know us, and we know you. We're deeply
grateful for your advocacy, outreach, and use of our software to advance our
joint scientific impact. At this point, you already know how to use and cite
our work independently. We value your autonomy and love hearing your success
stories. You‚Äôre always welcome to involve us in milestone publications, though
it‚Äôs not required for incremental work. If your proposals make significant use
use of RAPID, please consider including us ‚Äì along with appropriate budget ‚Äî so
we can sustainably support your efforts. What matters most here is open, candid
conversations about publications and proposals so we reach an understanding.
Code maintenance is not expected for this role.
Champions align with the **Stakeholder** role in our
[`GOVERNANCE.md`][URL_GOVER]
and may be invited to serve as **Advisors**.

### Core Team

The Core Team consists of active contributors to our project's codebase. We may
work in close proximity ‚Äî sharing hallways or meeting regularly, whether in
person or virtually ‚Äî on our project's design, architecture, features,
maintenance, and long-term evolution. The Core Team is routinely involved in a
variety of activities: commit code, develop documentation, submit pull
requests, engage with users, and manage GitHub issues. We also co-author papers
and collaborate on funding proposals.
This group includes the **Contributor**, **Committer**, and **Manager** roles
defined in our
[`GOVERNANCE.md`][URL_GOVER].

## Conclusion

By following these expectations, we can ensure a productive and respectful
collaboration that benefits everyone involved. Open science requires time,
dedication, and a shared commitment to advancing scientific knowledge. Let‚Äôs
work together to achieve meaningful impact while supporting the sustainability
of scientific research.
